# King County Housing Analysis

For this analysis, we worked on the King County House sales dataset. The main objective is to create the best model and see which features affect the home prices of King County. We will perform linear regression analysis on the data and perform various statistical methods to help predict prices of homes based on selected features.

# Process Overview



# Technologies Used

## Python
* Pandas for Data Cleaning & Data Manipulation
* Matplotlib and Seaborn for Data Visualization
* Numpy for Calculations
* SciPy/Statsmodels/Scikit Learn for Linear Regression
